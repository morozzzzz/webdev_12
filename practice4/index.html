					<h1 class="textheading">Lean startup</h1>
					<p class="text1">Lean startup is a popular set of principles to create and design startups under limited resources and tremendous uncertainty to build their ventures more flexibly and at lower cost. It is based on the idea that entrepreneurs can make their implicit assumptions about how their venture works explicit and empirically test them. The empirical tests is to de/validate these assumptions and to get an engaged understanding of the business model of the new ventures, and in doing so, the new ventures are created iteratively in a build–measure–learn loop. Hence, lean startup is a set of principle for entrepreneurial learning and business model design. More precisely, it is a set of design principles aimed for iteratively experiential learning under uncertainty in an engaged empirical manner. Typically, lean startup focuses on a few lean principles:</p>
					<ul class="middle">
						<li>find a problem worth solving,then define a solution,</li>
						<li>engage early adopters for market validation,</li>
						<li>continually test with smaller,faster iterations,</li>
						<li>build a function, measure customer response, and verify/refute the idea,</li>
						<li>evidence-based decisions on when to "pivot" by changing your plan's course,</li>
						<li>maximize the efforts for speed, learning, and focus.</li></ul>
					<p class="t2">A key principle of startup is to validate the market need before building a solution. Because startups are uncertain, you don’t want to waste time or money building something that has weak demand . Validating your ideas before deciding to invest heavily in building something is a wise move no matter how confident you are. Sure you may think you’ve solved a major problem, but does your target market care enough to invest in it themselves? Being overconfident in an idea and failing to validate it early on takes on unnecessary risk.</p>
